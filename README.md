# REAL-TIME OBJECT DETECTION AND TRACKING
This is the repository for the DTU Course 02456 Deep Learning project. 


Description  <br />
In this project, we developed 4 object detection models and evaluated them on a specific detection task. The project is implemented in Python relying on PyTorch as well as other packages. The repository also includes a notebook that can be run using Google Colab and be executed. This notebook will train a specifiec Faster R-CNN model.

Data set  <br />
The data set consists of video frames of beer and cola cons rolling on the floor. The data set can be found in the project folder /data/video1 and /data/video2.
