# REAL-TIME OBJECT DETECTION AND TRACKING
This is the repository for the DTU Course 02456 Deep Learning project. 
# Description
<p>In this project, we developed 4 object detection models and evaluated them on a specific detection task. The project is implemented in Python relying on PyTorch as well as other packages. The repository also includes a notebook that can be run using Google Colab and be executed. This notebook will train a specifiec Faster R-CNN model. All models and training results can be reproduced by executing the notebooks. Moreover, for a test of the real time performance the /tracking folder contains scripts that can be used for a webcam test and a test on a recorded video.<p>
# Data set
<p>The data set consists of video frames of beer and cola cons rolling on the floor. The data set can be found in the project folder /data/video1 and /data/video2.<p>
